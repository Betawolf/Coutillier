# Coutillier

**Coutillier** is a commandline syntax-checker for C# source code files, based on
[Gendarme](https://github.com/spouliot/gendarme), a code quality tool which runs
on .Net assembly files. 

The purpose of **Coutillier** is to provide warnings *before* your code goes to 
full compilation rather than after, so that they can be picked up by your editor
and any issues can be fixed early in the development cycle.  

As with **Gendarme**, **Coutillier** focuses on the type of errors and poor
coding practices which a compiler or parser might disregard.

## Functionality

**Coutillier** currently *doesn't work*. Maybe come back later.
